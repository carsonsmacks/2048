2048-python-patches
===========
A fork of [2048-python](https://github.com/yangshun/2048-python) by yangshun. The game uses the original 2048-python code as a base however I have altered the code to make it a more enjoyable experience.

Required:
TKinter 

Note:
The game has only been tested on Python 3.8 and on Linux.
To start the game, run:
    
    $ python3 puzzle.py

Configuration
==
You can configure the game by editing the config.py file.

Editing config.py allows you to change the controls of the game.

In order to edit the file, use the text editor of your choice. Replace "return 'default'" (line 2) with the prefered control scheme
(return 'vim' provides vim controls, for example)

To add custom control schemes edit constants.py. Lines 53-57 provide an example of how to create a control scheme. Make sure to uncomment and edit the lines.
